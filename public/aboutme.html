          <p>
            I enjoy various activities and learning new hobbies! But some things
            are constants in my life. While I am on the lookout for more
            exciting new fields to discover, here are my current key interests!

            <p>
              I love cooking food, any cuisine really. That being said, I do
              find myself quite proficient in both Asian and French cuisines (I
              grew up in France in a Chinese household).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some friends have gifted me another Japanese Kiritsuke Knife
              (left), this one being longer than my previous one (right). It's
              crazy sharp and perfectly balanced (as all things should be)!

            <p>
              While I love to cook, I think I love to eat even more. If I had
              multiple stomachs, they'd all be as full as my sole one I
              currently have. Can't stop (won't stop). I live in Paris, so in
              terms of cuisine variety, I am on the luckier side. But I gained
              over 10kg (22pounds) in less than a year because of constant
              eating out. Careful out there...

              This is one of my latest meals from my trip in HK @ Ding Tai Fung,
              amazing and fairly cheap!

              Not very eco-friendly, although some interesting alternatives
              exist. Trying to be more concious about my footprint, but it is a
              very hard sacrifice that I have a hard time making as of now
              (forgive me).

              Got into the trend since mid 2024, quite cathartic, although I've
              lost the habit very recently. Gotta get back into it depsite the
              colder days! And since I've very recently turned 30, I think I'm
              supposed to run a semi or 10k, or something like that?

              Never knew midnight sports sessions could feel so good. You sleep
              very well afterwards.

              Haven't been there in a while but want to now that I have more
              time! I've poured in quite a fair amount of hours into climbing,
              really fell in love with the sport during summer a couple years
              back. I remember spending hours watching Youtube videos on how to
              better climb, and then finding out that real life is much
              harsher...

              My old climbing gym I used to go to, should I pop by again? It is

              Ski season is around the corner, already have a first trip
              planned, why not more! Skiing is obviously something that may
              become a mythical sport due to climate change, and I grew fond of
              it through multiple ski trips when I was youger. It is quite
              exhausting, but the whole vibe around it is just something else.

              Started in Middle School with my first MMORPG Dofus (OGs know),
              been a gamer since I entered Engineering school (skipping classes
              was the key), and it has been an integral part of my life since
              then (although I do play way less since I've started working).

              Currently playing several games, but the new TFT season is on, and
              Dofus was relaunched in its newest version, Unity. I have to
              admit, I've put in more hours than I'd like to admit...

              I love dogs. All dogs. But I especially LOVE Corgis. I have no

              Here's a big photo of some dogs I met in Hong Kong. Very chill
              dogs. The best dogs ever. Not Corgis, but still very cute.
